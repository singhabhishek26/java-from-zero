// Identifiers - Which can be used for identification purposes
// - A name in java program is called a Identifier which can be used for identification purposes.
// - It can be class name, method name, variable name or Label name
// ex-
//
//class Test {
//    public static void main(String[] args){
//        int x = 10;
//    }
//}

// Test, main, String(as its a class in java), args, x - Above example has 5 Identifiers


// Rule for defining Java identifiers
//1. a to z, A to Z, 0 to 9, $ , _ (Allowed List of chars)
//2. Identifier should not start with number.
//3. Java identifiers are case sensitive.(ex - total and TOTAL are different)
//4. Max no of charachters allowed for Identifiers - No Limit
//5. Reserved Words can't be used as identifiers. ex- int if = 10 (will result in compile time error)
//6. All predefined Java Class names and interface names can be used as idenfiers (Not a good programming practise because it reduces readability and created confusion)
//     ex- int String = 8888;
//         System.out.println(String);
//
//         int Runnable = 8888;
//         System.out.println(Runnable);

//Note - If we will make wrong name we will get compile time error.
